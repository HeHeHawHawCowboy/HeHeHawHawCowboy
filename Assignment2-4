# Prompt the user to enter their salary and number of dependents
salary = float(input("Enter your salary: "))
numDependents = int(input("Enter the number of dependents: "))

# Calculate state withholding tax (6.5% of salary)
stateTax = salary * 0.065

# Calculate federal withholding tax (28% of salary)
federalTax = salary * 0.28

# Calculate dependent tax deductions (2.5% of salary per dependent)
dependentDeduction = salary * 0.025 * numDependents

# Calculate total withholding (state tax + federal tax + dependent deductions)
totalWithholding = stateTax + federalTax + dependentDeduction

# Calculate take-home pay (salary - total withholding)
takeHomePay = salary - totalWithholding

# Output the results
print("State Tax: $", stateTax)
